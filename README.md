# PowerShare
A mobile application letting users share power banks on the go.

## Aim
The aim of this application is to give its users the ability to charge their devices while on the go. Considering the developing technology, power consumption is a big problem. In emergency cases while you are out, a temporary solution for that can be Power Share.

## Usage
It is simple. The app gives a notification when the buttery runs to critical levels or the user manually opens the app and searches for the nearest avalaible power banks. Once the user gets the power bank (he/she gets it himself/herself), it starts charging the phone. According to the usage, a fee will be charged on the user. Finally, when the charging has been completed or user has finished its usage, the power bank will be returned to the nearest power station suggested from the app by the user.
**Important note** : Considering the battery is totally drained, the user must wait at the corresponding station until the device is turned on(e.g. 2 mins). In this time, user should start the application. When the application has been launched and fee timer has been started, user is allowed to leave terminal.

## Assumptions for the demo
* Adequate number of stations are available
* Adequate number of power banks are available
* The power banks have an embedded system that detects when the user has plugged in the charging cable to the phone such that it sets the availability status to "occupied" and on the contrary when the power bank is returned back to the station, availability status is set to "available".
* The payment method is done online and assumed to be implemented ( Important note: in this project the users credits will be hardcoded.)
* The user has an account and the authentication is also assumed to be implemented.

## What will be demonstrated in the demo session?
* According to the user's current location the nearest power stations will be shown and routed in demand.
* When the user has completed its usage with the power bank, the closest power station will be shown and routed to the user to get it back.
* The fee calculation will be shown.
